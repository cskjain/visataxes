Resident Country is the country, which was your main country of work or education where you paid your
taxes, before living in the United States.<br><br>

<u>Example 2:</u><br><br>
A student has his citizenship country as China. He has been working in Singapore for a few years, paying his taxes in Singapore,
before visiting United States.<br><br> In this case, the Resident Country for Tax Treaty calculation is Singapore and not China.
